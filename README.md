# Comprehensive-Analysis-of-Airline-Passenger-Satisfaction-Predictive-Modeling-and-Evaluation
Customer satisfaction is crucial in the airline industry as it fosters customer loyalty, drives profitability, and attracts new customers through positive word-of-mouth. However, identifying and analyzing the factors that influence satisfaction can be challenging. Machine learning techniques offer a solution to this problem. This project evaluates passenger satisfaction in the airline industry using various machine learning methods, including K-Nearest Neighbors, Decision Tree, Neural Network, Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, Random Forest, and AdaBoost. The analysis utilizes a dataset from an airline survey on passenger satisfaction, aiming to identify the key factors that contribute to satisfaction and create a predictive model. Feature selection techniques, such as Chi-square, wrapper methods and PermutationImportance are employed to enhance the model's accuracy. Performance evaluation metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and ROC AUC, are used to assess the models. The results show that AdaBoost achieves the highest accuracy, with Random Forest and XGBoost also performing well. Feature importance identified factors such as travel type of travel, inflight services, and comfort as pivotal in passenger satisfaction. This project provides a data-driven approach to enhance customer satisfaction in the airline industry.
